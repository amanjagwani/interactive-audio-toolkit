# Interactive Audio Toolkit (IAT)

IAT is a simple, header-only toolkit designed for the creation of interactive audio experiences with microcontrollers. IAT is a C++ toolkit that was developed to facilitate flexibility, creativity, and efficiency in designing interactive audio experiences with simple, cheap, and ubiquitous microcontrollers like the ESP32, STM32, and Raspberry Pi Pico. It is a set of C++ classes or objects that was developed within the Arduino and PlatformIO frameworks, enabling cross-platform development and deployment. The objects mainly encompass different sensor inputs, such as ultrasonic and LIDAR sensors, digital and mechanical audio outputs, and a control signal generator in the form of a sequencer.
This repository is organized as a platformIO project containing all the IAT headers and an example targetting an ESP32 board in the main.cpp file. All dependencies required for reading sensor data/controlling actuators are also included.
